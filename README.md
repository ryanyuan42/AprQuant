# AprQuant

Here is a project by Tianshu Yuan.  
I finished a coding test with Akuna Capital yesterday.  
I couldn't finish it and it really pissed me off because I totally how to do what they asked mathematically but I just cannot finish it in code.  
There is big disadvantage using python and its packages, it's that you get lazy and unfamiliar with something that you should actually code yourself. Thinking of that, I started to think of my project started in April called AprQuant.It's somewhere I want to finish some models. I never intend to write raw matrix manipulations in this project. But since I faied on that test, I think it's probably best to start right now.  
Therefore, I decided to code some primitive things in this project such as matrix, inverse, determinant, distances, some optimization methods, matrix decomposition, ordinary least squares, etc. 
Of couse I know that I will never use such package in real coding task. But it's good to do that.
